====================================
EightPct_DatasetForClusterAnalysis dataset
====================================
(1) This synthetic dataset is presented in figure 1(a) of 
Ghamarian, Yu & Marquis, Morphological classification 
of dense objects in atom probe tomography data, Ultramicroscopy, 2020. 

(2) Copper has the tendecy of forming dense objects (mass to charge ratio of 62.9-63.1 and 64.9-65.1)
For the identification of the dense objects in this dataset set the MinClusterSize and MinSamples values to 50 and 20, respectively.  
The value of the probability threshold should be set to 0.9. 


====================================
R94_10476-v03 dataset
====================================
(1) This is a real dataset which is presented in figure 1(b) of 
Ghamarian, Yu & Marquis, Morphological classification 
of dense objects in atom probe tomography data, Ultramicroscopy, 2020. 

(2) Silicon has the tendecy of forming dense objects (mass to charge ratio of 13.9-14.2, 14.4-14.6 and 14.9,15.1)
For the identification of the dense objects in this dataset set the MinClusterSize and MinSamples values to 25 and 15, respectively.  
The value of the probability threshold should be set to 0.9.
